## 1. Payroll Management System
- The Payroll Management System is a Java-based application designed to streamline the process of managing employee payroll and attendance within an organization. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface for administrators to perform tasks such as adding new employees, managing employee information, recording attendance, calculating salaries, and generating payroll reports. The system utilizes MySQL 8.0 as the backend database to store and retrieve employee data and integrates JCalendar for date selection functionality.
